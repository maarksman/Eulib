  <p>Let L be a <a knowl="knowlcontent/field.html" knowl-uid="2" class="" href="">field</a>. A subfield of L is a subset K of L that is closed under the field operations of L and under taking inverses in L. In other words, K is a field with respect to the field operations inherited from L. The larger field L is then said to be an extension field of K. To simplify notation and terminology, one says that L / K (read as "L over K") is a field extension to signify that L is an extension field of K.

  <p>A field is a set together with two operations called addition and multiplication. An operation is a mapping that associates an element of the set to every pair of its elements. The result of the addition of a and b is called the sum of a and b and denoted a + b. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of a and b is called the product of a and b, and denoted ab or a⋅b. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as field axioms. In the following definitions, a, b and c are arbitrary elements of F.
</p><ul>
  <li>Associativity of addition and multiplication: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c.</li>
  <li>Commutativity of addition and multiplication: a + b = b + a and a · b = b · a.</li>
  <li>Additive and multiplicative identity: there exist two different elements 0 and 1 in F such that a + 0 = a and a · 1 = a.</li>
  <li>Additive inverses: for every a in F, there exists an element in F, denoted −a, called additive inverse of a, such that a + (−a) = 0.</li>
  <li>Multiplicative inverses: for every a ≠ 0 in F, there exists an element in F, denoted by a−1, 1/a, or 1/a, called the multiplicative inverse of a, such that a · a−1 = 1.</li>
  <li>Distributivity of multiplication over addition: a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c) .</li>
</ul>
