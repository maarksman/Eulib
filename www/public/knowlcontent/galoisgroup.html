  <p>Suppose that E is an <a knowl="fieldextension.html">extension</a> of the <a knowl="field.html">field</a> F (written as E/F and read E over F). An <a knowl="automorphism.html">automorphism</a> of E/F is defined to be an <a knowl="automorphism.html">automorphism</a> of E that fixes F pointwise. In other words, an <a knowl="automorphism.html">automorphism</a> of E/F is an <a knowl="isomorphism.html">isomorphism</a> α from E to E such that α(x) = x for each x in F. The set of all <a knowl="automorphism.html">automorphisms</a> of E/F forms a group with the operation of function composition. This group is sometimes denoted by <a knowl="automorphism.html">Aut(E/F)</a>.
</p><ul>
<li>If E/F is a Galois extension, then <a knowl="automorphism.html">Aut(E/F)</a> is called the Galois group of (the extension) E over F, and is usually denoted by Gal(E/F).</li>

<li>If E/F is not a Galois extension, then the Galois group of (the extension) E over F is sometimes defined as <a knowl="automorphism.html">Aut(G/F)</a>, where G is the Galois closure of E.</li>
