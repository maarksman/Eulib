		<p>Let L be a <a knowl="field.html">field</a>. A subfield of L is a subset K of L that is closed under the field operations of L and under taking inverses in L. In other words, K is a field with respect to the field operations inherited from L. The larger field L is then said to be an extension field of K. To simplify notation and terminology, one says that L / K (read as "L over K") is a field extension to signify that L is an extension field of K.
