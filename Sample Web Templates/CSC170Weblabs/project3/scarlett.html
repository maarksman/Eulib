			<p>
				Johansson was born in New York City. Her father, Karsten Johansson, is an architect originally from Copenhagen, Denmark, and her paternal grandfather, Ejner Johansson, was a screenwriter and director. Her mother, Melanie Sloan, a producer, comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family from the Bronx; Sloan's ancestors were Jewish immigrants from Poland and Minsk in the Russian Empire. She has an older sister, Vanessa, also an actress; an older brother, Adrian; a twin brother, Hunter (who appeared with her in the film Manny & Lo);  and an older half-brother, Christian, from her father's first marriage. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Johansson grew up in a household with "little money", and with a mother who was a "film buff". She and her twin brother attended PS 41 elementary school in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan. Johansson began her theatrical training by attending and graduating from Professional Children's School in Manhattan in 2002. 
			</p>

				<h2>Charity Work</h2>

			<p>
				In 2005, Johansson became a Global Ambassador for the aid and development agency Oxfam. In March 2008, a UK-based bidder paid £20,000 on an eBay auction to benefit Oxfam, winning a hair and makeup treatment, a pair of tickets and a chauffeured trip to accompany Johansson on a 20-minute date to the world premiere of He's Just Not That Into You. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In January 2014, Johansson resigned from her Oxfam position after facing criticism for her promotion of SodaStream, whose main factory is based in Mishor Adumim, an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, as Oxfam opposes all trade with such Israeli settlements.[196]Johansson said she and Oxfam "have a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to theBoycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement". In response to her resignation, Oxfam stated that it was "grateful for her many contributions ... [in] helping to highlight the impact of natural disasters and raise funds to save lives and fight poverty". 
			</p>

			<h2>Endorsements</h2>
			
			<p>
				Johansson has appeared in advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein, L'Oréal and Louis Vuitton, and has been the face of Spanish brand Mango since 2009. After appearing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala with Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, Johansson was announced as the face of the new Dolce & Gabbana make-up collection in early 2009. She made a personal appearance at the London store, Selfridges, on July 31, 2009, to help launch and promote the line. Johansson was also the first Hollywood celebrity to become an ambassador for a champagne house. She is the spokesperson for Moët & Chandon. In January 2014, the Israeli Sodastream home-carbonation system company announced Johannson as its first brand ambassador. She has stayed the course, though her involvement has generated controversy.
