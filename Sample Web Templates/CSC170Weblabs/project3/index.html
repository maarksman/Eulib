					<p>Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He founded and Directs the World Wide Consortium (W3C) the forum for technical development of the Web. He founded theWeb Foundation whose mission is that the WWW serves Humanity, and co-founded the Open Data Institute in London. His research group at MIT's Computer Science and AI Lab ("CSAIL") plans to re-decentralize the Web. Tim spends a lot of time fighting for rights such as privacy, freedom and openness of the Web.</p>

					<p>A graduate of Oxford University, Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory, in 1989. He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were refined as Web technology spread.</p>

					Johansson was born in New York City. Her father, Karsten Johansson, is an architect originally from Copenhagen, Denmark, and her paternal grandfather, Ejner Johansson, was a screenwriter and director. Her mother, Melanie Sloan, a producer, comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family from the Bronx; Sloan's ancestors were Jewish immigrants from Poland and Minsk in the Russian Empire. She has an older sister, Vanessa, also an actress; an older brother, Adrian; a twin brother, Hunter (who appeared with her in the film Manny & Lo);  and an older half-brother, Christian, from her father's first marriage. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Johansson grew up in a household with "little money", and with a mother who was a "film buff". She and her twin brother attended PS 41 elementary school in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan. Johansson began her theatrical training by attending and graduating from Professional Children's School in Manhattan in 2002.

				  	Eric Emerson Schmidt was born in Falls Church, Virginia, and grew up in Falls Church and Blacksburg, Virginia He was one of three sons of Eleanor, who had a master's degree in psychology, and Wilson Emerson Schmidt, a professor of international economics at Virginia Tech and Johns Hopkins University, who worked at the U.S. Treasury Department during the Nixon Administration. 
				  </p>

				  <p>
				 	 Schmidt graduated from Yorktown High School in the Yorktown neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia, in 1972, after earning eight varsity letter awards in long-distance running. He then attended <em>Princeton University</em>, where he started as an architecture major but then switched and earned a B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1976. From 1976 to 1980, Schmidt stayed at the International House Berkeley, where he met his future wife, <strong>Wendy Boyle</strong>. In 1979, at the University of California, <em>Berkeley</em>, Schmidt then earned an M.S. degree for designing and implementing a network (Berknet) linking the campus computer center with the CS and EECS departments. There, he also earned a Ph.D. degree in 1982 in EECS, with a dissertation about the problems of managing distributed software development and tools for solving these problems.

				 <p>Margaret Hamilton was born in August 17, 1936 (age 80);Educated in University of Michigan and Earlham College; She is the CEO of Hamilton Technologies Inc., which was developed around the Universal System Language based on her paradigm of Development Before the Fact(DBTF) for system and software design. She is also a Computer Scientist, System Engineer, and was Director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for Apollo space program.</p>
				 
				<p>Margaret Heafield was born in Paoli, Indiana to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (n√©e Partington). After graduating from Hancock High School in 1954, she started out in mathematics at the University of Michigan and earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from Earlham College in 1958. She briefly taught high school mathematics and French upon graduation, in order to support her husband while he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard, with the ultimate goal of pursuing a graduate degree at a later time. She moved to Boston, Massachusetts with the intention of doing graduate study in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University. In 1960 she took an interim position at MIT to develop software for predicting weather on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers (at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC) for professor Edward Norton Lorenz in the meteorology department. Hamilton wrote that at that time, computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.</p>
